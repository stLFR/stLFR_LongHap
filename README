This script is writen for individual genome phasing based on hg19 reference genome for now. More optional reference genomes are to be added.

Usage:
perl Main.pl <indexed sorted bam> <vcf> <window size> <max LFR> <min SupportBarcodes> <min Link> <shellDir> <outDir_tmp> <outDir_final>

Detailed Description:
<indexed sorted bam> is an alignment file in BAM format which should be sorted and indexed in advance
<vcf> shoud store variant calling result in VCF format
<window size> is set for each phasing window, 10MB is suggested
<max LFR> is decided by the maximum length of DNA fragment
<min SupportBarcodes> is minimum count of supporting barcode for each variant
<min Link> is minimum count of linked info
<shellDir> is an directory storing shell scripts which need to be executed, absolute path is suggested
<outDir_tmp> is a temporary directory storing split phasing result, absolute path is suggested
<outDir_final> is a directory storing the final phasing result, absolute path is suggested.

Example:
perl Main.pl input.bam input.vcf 10000000 300000 1 1 shellDir outDir_tmp outDir_final
After running this command, you will find 23 shell scripts in shellDir, with the names of "run.chr1.sh" or "run.chrX.sh", which could be executed parallelly using qsub-sge.
